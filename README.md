# Silent-Sugar-Sniper 🧬
Diabetes is a silent killer, SVM is the sniper.

A Machine Learning project to predict diabetes using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Built to assist early diagnosis through data-driven insights.

## 🔍 Overview
This project applies SVM to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes, based on health-related attributes. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

## 💡 Features
- Preprocessing with scaling and missing value handling
- SVM Model training & evaluation
- Accuracy
- Confusion matrix visualization

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name**: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset  
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes)
